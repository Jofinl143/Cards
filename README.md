Short Description of the App

- [ ] This App has got two tabs Live cards and Saved cards.
- [ ] On Live cards tab user can Save/Bookmark the card by clicking on the Plus image.
- [ ] Once the card is saved it will immediately appear on saved cards tab.
- [ ] I am using SQLite3 for save operation.
- [ ] Unit tests are also added.


One thing I notice is that, each time I fetch the API it gives me different values, not sure if 
this is a feature or a bug.
